    skills: "PYTHON,NLP",
    disc:"Automated MCQ generation is a popular research area. It is important for students to expertise in their field of study. Our project consists of 2 phases (Video Summarization, MCQ Generation). In the fast-growing technology today, we can see that the students are being given video lectures in institutions. Even though it’s effective in learning the concept from scratch using a video, it’s not very helpful as in the end it takes more time for revision. In our attempt to Video Summarization, we look to create a certain degree of synopsis that explains the most informative parts of the video. The most important thing in learning is assessment and the question is crucial for assessment. Online tests are becoming more common at universities, colleges and other educational institutions."

    name: "TRAFFIC SIGN RECOGNITION",
    image: 'assets/proj5.jpg',
    skills: "PYTHON,CNN,Deep Learning ",
disc:"Detecting the traffic signals which are present on either side of the roads is very important to maintain the safety. It plays an essential role in intelligent transportation system. But now due to the ease in the demand for autonomous cars (Automation), where the cars can be driven without the physical presence of humans, this recognition of the signs become much more important. The system can be utilized for driver assis- tance and also helps in reducing accidents. Not Only for Self-Driving Cars but even to human drivers, it is difficult to recognize the traffic signs in situations like Driving at nights, in different weather conditions which is dangerous for both human drivers and also pedestrains.Sometimes human insight mistakes of seeing such traffic signs may lead to accidents, this can be avoided by using the model. Traffic signs provide infor- mation about the traffic rules, road conditions and route directions and assist the drivers for better and safe driving."  },
